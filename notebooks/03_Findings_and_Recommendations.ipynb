    "# Credit Risk Analysis: Key Findings and Recommendations for QuickPesa\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "The primary goal of this analysis was to identify key drivers of loan defaults within QuickPesa's portfolio using historical data from the `QuickPesaDB`. By understanding these factors, QuickPesa can enhance its risk assessment strategies and minimize credit losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Problem Statement\n",
    "QuickPesa is seeking to reduce its loan default rate, which currently stands at [Insert Overall Default Rate from EDA]%. This project investigated customer demographic, financial, loan-specific, and behavioral attributes to pinpoint characteristics associated with higher default risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Tools and Methodology\n",
    "- **Data Source:** `QuickPesaDB` (SQL Server) containing customer, loan, application, credit info, and mobile money transaction data.\n",
    "- **Data Extraction:** SQL queries executed via Python (`pyodbc`).\n",
    "- **Analysis & Visualization:** Python with `pandas` for data manipulation, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization.\n",
    "- **Process:** Data was extracted, cleaned (handling missing values, feature engineering), and then subjected to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to compare profiles of defaulting vs. non-defaulting borrowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Key Insights Discovered\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Here, you'll detail each insight, referencing charts/stats from your EDA. Example below)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insight 1: Credit Score and Affordability are Paramount\n",
    "- Customers with a **`CreditScore` below 480 showed a default rate of X%**, significantly higher than the Y% for those with scores above 600.\n",
    "- The engineered **Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio** proved to be a powerful indicator. Applicants with a DTI greater than 0.40 defaulted Z% more frequently.\n",
    "*(Embed or link to relevant charts from EDA notebook)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insight 2: Mobile Money Behavior as a Proxy for Financial Health\n",
    "- A pattern of frequent overdrafts (`OverdraftsLast3Months > 2`) was observed in A% of defaulters compared to B% of non-defaulters.\n",
    "- Lower `AvgDepositLast6Months` from mobile money transactions correlated with higher default likelihood.\n",
    "*(Embed or link to relevant charts from EDA notebook)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insight 3: Impact of Employment and Loan Purpose\n",
    "- Default rates were highest among customers with `EmploymentStatus` as 'Unemployed' (C%) and 'Casual Worker' (D%).\n",
    "- While `LoanPurpose` of 'Emergency' had a moderate default rate overall, it was significantly riskier for applicants with low `CreditScore` and high DTI.\n",
    "*(Embed or link to relevant charts from EDA notebook)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Profile of a High-Risk Customer Segment:\n",
    "Based on the analysis, a customer is more likely to be high-risk if they exhibit several of the following:\n",
    "- `CreditScore` < 480\n",
    "- DTI > 0.40\n",
    "- More than 2 mobile money overdrafts in the 3 months prior to application.\n",
    "- `EmploymentStatus` is 'Unemployed' or 'Casual Worker'.\n",
    "- Low `AvgDepositLast6Months` in mobile money.\n",
    "- A history of `PreviousDefaults`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Business Recommendations & Potential Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "### How a Business Would Benefit From This Work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Enhanced Underwriting Rules:**\n",
    "    * **Action:** Implement stricter DTI thresholds (e.g., flag applications with DTI > 0.35 for manual review or automatic decline if other risk factors are present).\n",
    "    * **Benefit:** Reduce the approval of loans to individuals who are likely to struggle with repayments, directly lowering default rates.\n",
    "2.  **Refined Credit Scoring Input:**\n",
    "    * **Action:** Integrate `OverdraftsLast3Months` and `AvgDepositLast6Months` (or similar mobile money metrics) as features in the internal credit assessment model.\n",
    "    * **Benefit:** Improve the accuracy of risk prediction by capturing real-time financial behavior not always present in traditional credit bureau data.\n",
    "3.  **Dynamic Loan Offers:**\n",
    "    * **Action:** For applicants falling into a moderate-risk category (e.g., fair `CreditScore` but high DTI for a specific `LoanPurpose`), consider offering a smaller loan amount or shorter term than requested.\n",
    "    * **Benefit:** Mitigate risk while still serving a broader customer base. Potentially improve repayment success for these customers.\n",
    "4.  **Targeted Monitoring & Collections:**\n",
    "    * **Action:** For active loans belonging to customers who matched the high-risk profile at the time of application, implement more proactive monitoring and earlier intervention in collection efforts if signs of missed payments appear.\n",
    "    * **Benefit:** Increase the chances of recovery and reduce the severity of losses from defaulted loans.\n",
    "5.  **Product Strategy Adjustments:**\n",
    "    * **Action:** Review the terms or marketing for `LoanProducts` that show disproportionately high default rates within specific customer segments (e.g., 'Emergency' loans for low-income, low-score applicants).\n",
    "    * **Benefit:** Align products better with the repayment capacity of target segments, potentially by adding safeguards or alternative, less risky products.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Quantifiable Impact:** A conservative estimate suggests that by tightening approval criteria for the top 10% riskiest profiles identified, QuickPesa could reduce its overall default volume by X-Y% within 6-12 months, leading to significant savings in provisions and recovery costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Limitations\n",
    "- The analysis is based on available historical data within `QuickPesaDB`. External factors (e.g., macroeconomic shifts) were not included.\n",
    "- Mobile money aggregation was based on available data; more granular transaction categorization could yield deeper insights.\n",
    "- This is a diagnostic analysis; a predictive machine learning model would be required for automated, forward-looking risk scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Future Work\n",
    "- Develop and deploy a machine learning model for default prediction.\n",
    "- Conduct A/B testing on new underwriting rules.\n",
    "- Perform a deeper cohort analysis on customer repayment behavior over time.\n"
