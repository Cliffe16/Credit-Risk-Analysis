# Credit-Risk-Analysis
The objective of this project was to conduct a thorough credit risk analysis to identify the key drivers of loan defaults and uncover characteristics of high-risk customers. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights that QuickPesa can use to refine its lending strategies, minimize potential losses, and promote sustainable growth.
